        Args:
            data_dirs: Directories containing h5 files to read from.
            sequence_length: The number of tokens per sample if reading
                from a corpus. Must be `None` if the data has already been
                preprocessed into samples.
            read_extra_token: Whether to read and return one extra token
                after the end of the sequence. This can be useful for language
                modeling tasks where you want to construct the labels as an
                shifted version of the inputs. Setting this to `True` differs
                from increasing `sequence_length` by one in that the extra token
                returned due to this flag will be included in some other
                sequence as the first token. Will be ignored if
                `sequence_length` is `None`.
            data_subset: A string specifying the subset of the corpus to
                consider. E.g. if `data_subset="0.0-0.75"` is specified, only
                samples in the first 3/4 of the dataset will be considered and
                the last 1/4 of the dataset will be completely untouched. The
                self reported length will be the length of the valid portion
                of the dataset (e.g. the first 3/4), and any attempt to access
                an element beyond this length will result in an exception.
            sort: Whether to sort the file paths after reading them. This flag
                is included for backwards compatibility and should almost always
                be set to `True`. It will be removed in the future.
            use_vsl: Flag to enable variable sequence length training. 
                It requires the dataset to have two extra features: the 
                `attention_span` of keys and the `position_ids` of tokens.

        datasets: a list of objects implementing `__len__` and `__getitem__`
        weights: a list of weights associated with each dataset. `weights`
            must have the same length as `datasets` and contain only nonnegative
            values. All weights will be normalized to sum to 1.
        interleave: whether or not samples of different datasets should be
            interleaved together. If all the datasets are preprocessed into
            sequences and shuffled before being written to disk, then setting
            this flag will allow you to avoid doing any shuffling at run time
            while still having samples from the different datasets intermingled,
            which may be desirable for enabling sequential disk reads. This is
            implemented in a way that samples within a dataset are not shuffled
            in relation to each other, i.e. sample 0 of dataset 0 will always
            have a smaller index than sample 1 of dataset 0.
        seed: the random seed used for interleaving. Ignored if `interleave`
            is `False`.
